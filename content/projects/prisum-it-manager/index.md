I rebuilt the [prisum.org](https://www.prisum.org) website completely
from scratch with new [content management](https://bolt.cm/) software.
Previously, the site was entirely hand-coded, which made updates extremely
difficult and time-consuming. Rebuilding the site with new browser-based content
management software and templating massively increased maintainability, along with
allowing non-developers to easily and quickly make content updates. In the process
of rebuilding the site, I implemented lazy image, font, and CSS loading, automatic
image resizing and compression, critical CSS generation, and no-reload page
transitions which reduced monthly bandwidth usage and page load times by 95%,
improving SEO.
