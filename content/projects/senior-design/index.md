For my senior design, our team had to design, build, and fly an R/C aircraft designed
to deliver a payload to a target a couple of miles away and return back to base.
There were many design limitations in this project including a 9 foot maximum wingspan,
and a 12 pound maximum takeoff weight. The payload was around shoebox sized and weighed
4 pounds and our budget was only about $200. Finally, the aircraft had to fit inside
a Pelican case before launch.

Creating a design to drop a payload mid-flight that
represented a 1/3 of the aircraft weight and could be repeatably disassembled
and reassembled was no easy feat. I used SOLIDWORKS did all of CAD modelling for
this project. Everything was parametrically designed so that quick modifications
could be made to test with CFD.

The final aircraft came out extremely close to the CAD model. The detailed model
helped a lot with being able to use a CNC to machine foam to the precise
shapes required. While the design did up having some Cg issues and required
exceeded the maximum takeoff weight to correct this, the aircraft did work, and we
were one of the few teams to reliably have our payload separate in-flight.
