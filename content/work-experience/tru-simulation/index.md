Unfortunately, this internship was shortened to only 6 weeks due to COVID. While I was
there, a new Cessna Citation Latitude simulator was being finished.
I ran through all of the manual test procedures that had been prepared
and identified issues in the software and tests. This was to make sure there
would be no surprises once representatives from the customer arrived to perform the same
tests and ensure that the simulator correctly replicated the behavior of the real
aircraft.

Once the flight instructors from the customer arrived to inspect the simulator,
I went through the test procedures with them and recorded their feedback.

Not long after my internship, the Citation Latitude simulator was successfully
delivered to FlightSafety International in Farnborough:

Finally, I also researched an alternative
for TRU's homegrown certification document generator. The challenges associated with
this were the need to combine many PDF files, tables, charts, and other images
into a single PDF, add a header and page number to every page, and create
a table of contents. I was able to create a proof-of-concept replacement that
met these needs with LaTeX.
