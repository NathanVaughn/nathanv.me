I worked as a Python developer within [Bell's Innovation group](https://www.bellflight.com/experience/innovation), primarily focusing on fleet simulation and DevOps.

- Rearchitected a SQL server data analysis workflow with Databricks and Azure Batch to save over $30k annually
- Automated testing, static code analysis, and deployments with Azure Pipelines
- Developed a process for repeatable mass deployments of mission software onto air-launched drones
- Participated in test events and provided on-site customer support for mission-critical software
- Simplified Python code distribution and re-usability using JFrog Artifactory
- Volunteered with the Bell Vertical Robotics Competition for high-school students as the lead software engineer writing control software, documentation, and answering student questions

I was also filmed for a segment about AI, that was presented in the Microsoft Ignite
2021 conference.
