Unfortunately, this internship was shortened to 6 weeks due to COVID. While I was
there, a new Cessna Citation Latitude simulator was being finished.
I ran through the entire all of the manual test procedures that had been prepared
and identified issues in the software and test procedures. This was to ensure there
would be surprises once representatives from the customer arrived to perform the same
tests and ensure that the simulator correctly replicated the behavior of the real
aircraft.

As I was the one most familiar with the tests, I then ran through the test procedures
again with the flight instructors from the customer and recorded feedback.

Not long after my internship, the Citation Latitude simulator was successfully
delivered to FlightSafety International in Farnborough:

Finally, I also researched an alternative
for TRU's homegrown certification document generator. The challenges associated with
this were the need to combine many PDF files, tables, charts, and other images
into a single PDF, add a header and page number to every page, and create
a table of contents. I was able to create a proof-of-concept replacement that
met these needs with LaTeX.
