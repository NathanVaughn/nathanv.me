I am working as a Simulation Engineer at
[Fisher Controls](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/fisher)
in Marshalltown, Iowa, performing FEA analysis of Fisher's valve and
instrument products.

Besides my core job responsibilities, I've been involved in a lot of side activities.
I am part of our recruiting team, attending local university career fairs and conducting
interviews. As furthering STEM education is very important to me,
I am part of our Marshalltown FIRST robotics initiative, which sponsors
local teams and plans and runs qualifier events. Additionally, I am on the Marshalltown
planning committee for Emerson's [We Love STEM Day](https://www.emerson.com/WeLoveSTEM),
where we bring in hundreds of elementary and middle school students to our facility
for a half-day to learn with fun STEM activities.

Last but not least, I have been part of multiple work-sponsored combat robotics teams
that have competed with
[others in the community](https://www.timesrepublican.com/news/todays-news/2024/11/gregg-young-marshalltown-entries-win-big-at-mcc-battlebots-competition/).
