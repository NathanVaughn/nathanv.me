I am working as a Product Engineer in the Special Products group of
[Fisher Controls](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/fisher) in
Marshalltown, Iowa. As a Product Engineer, I am responsible for answering and providing engineering input to inquiries from sales and manufacturing worldwide for many of Fisher's largest sliding stem product lines.

These questions range from sales quotes for customers to manufacturing problems,
to field support issues. As Fisher has been around since the 1880s, this presents
many unique challenges, especially supporting products that were designed
and sold before desktop computers were available.

Additionally, as part of Special Products, I work on engineering special orders, which often contain unique material, temperature, pressure, or other requirements.
