I am working as a Product Engineer in the Special Products group of
[Fisher Controls](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/fisher) in
Marshalltown, Iowa. As a Product Engineer, I am responsible for answering and
providing engineering input to any and all inquires around the world for a number of
Fisher sliding stem control valve product lines that I am responsible for.

These questions range from sales quotes for customers to manufacturing problems,
to field support issues. As Fisher has been around since the 1880s, this presents
a lot of unique challenges, especially supporting products that were designed
and sold before desktop computers were available.

Additionally, as part of Special Products, I work on engineering orders that are outside
the scope of Fisher's normal catalog, which often contain unique material,
temperature, and/or pressure requirements.
