I am working as a Product Engineer in the Special Products Group of
[Fisher Controls](https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation/fisher) in
Marshalltown, Iowa. I am responsible for answering and providing engineering input
to inquiries from sales and manufacturing around the world for a number of Fisher
sliding stem product lines. Additionally, I work on engineering orders that are outside
the scope of Fisher's normal catalog, which often contain unique material,
temperature, and/or pressure requirements.
