**Hi, I'm Nathan Vaughn.** I'm currently a
[Product Engineer at Fisher Controls]({{< relref "/work-experience/emerson" >}}).

I have a degree in aerospace engineering with a minor in non-destructive
evaluation from Iowa State University. I've worked professionally and personally
on a variety of projects, from building my own high-performance computing cluster
to writing software for commercial aircraft avionics. I'm a big fan of aviation,
building computers, and also volunteer my time with robotics competitions for
high-school students.
