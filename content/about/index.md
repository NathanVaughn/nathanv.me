**Hi, I'm Nathan Vaughn.** I'm currently a
[Simulation Engineer at Fisher Controls]({{< relref "/work-experience/emerson/simulation-engineer" >}}).

I have a degree in aerospace engineering with a minor in non-destructive
evaluation from Iowa State University. I've worked professionally and personally
on a variety of projects, from building my own
[high-performance computing cluster]({{< relref "/projects/high-performance-computing-cluster" >}})
to working on
[3D vision technology for air-to-air refueling]({{< relref "/work-experience/collins-aerospace" >}}).
Outside of work, I volunteer my time with robotics competitions for
middle and high-school students. I'm a big fan of aviation,
building computers, and Python programming.
