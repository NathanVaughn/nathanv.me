  Hi, I'm Nathan Vaughn. I am an aerospace engineer with a minor in non-destructive evaluation from Iowa State University.
  I've worked professionally and personally on a variety of projects, from building my own high-performance computing cluster to writing software for commercial aircraft avionics.

  I'm a big fan of aviation, building computers, and also volunteer my time with robotics competitions for high-school students.
