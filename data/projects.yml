  description: OpenAircraftManager is a program designed to let you bulk edit aircraft.cfg files for Microsoft Flight Simulator X or Prepar3D (a FSX fork). This is meant to help save time instead of manually going through multiple `[fltsim.x]` entries to change a single field. It is built with Python 3 and PyQt.

  description: I rebuilt the [prisum.org](https://www.prisum.org) website completely from scratch with new [content management](https://bolt.cm/) software. Previously, the site was entirely hand-coded, which made updates extremely difficult and time-consuming. Rebuilding the site with new browser-based content management software and templating massively increased maintainability, along with allowing non-developers to easily and quickly make content updates. In the process of rebuilding the site, I implemented lazy image, font, and CSS loading, automatic image resizing and compression, critical CSS generation, and no-reload page transitions which reduced monthly bandwidth usage and page load times by 95%, improving SEO.

  description: Using what I learned while building [prisum.org](https://www.prisum.org), I rebuilt this website around the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator. The content and theme are tightly coupled around structured data files ([example](https://github.com/NathanVaughn/nathanv.me/blob/master/data/workexperience.yml)). The theme is built with [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) for the main CSS framework, [lazySizes](https://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/index.html) for lazy image loading, and [MixItUp](https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup/) for categorizing projects. Multiple npm [scripts](https://github.com/NathanVaughn/nathanv.me/blob/master/package.json) along with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/NathanVaughn/nathanv.me/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) are used to automatically generate all CSS and JS assets, build the site, and publish it on every commit automatically.

  description: I assisted in designing and constructing a compute cluster for PrISUm out of recycled hardware. The cluster consists of seven desktops with quad-core Intel Core i7 processors with 8GB of RAM, each running a build of CentOS. This gives the cluster a combined compute capacity of 28 CPU cores and 56GB of shared memory. All of the nodes are connected on a local gigabit ethernet network. The head node of the cluster runs Sun Grid Engine for job scheduling and has 1TB of network storage for applications and user workspace. The cluster is primarily used by the team for computational fluid dynamics simulations with STAR-CCM+ and MATLAB optimization problems. When the cluster is not in use, it contributes to community grid computing projects.
